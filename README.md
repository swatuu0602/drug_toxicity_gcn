# drug_toxicity_gcn
 This repository contains the implementation of a model for predicting drug toxicity using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Drug toxicity is a critical aspect of drug development and safety assessment, and leveraging GCNs allows for the incorporation of complex molecular interactions and structural information in the prediction process.
